In my daily life, besides working as a Software developer, I'm always interested into launching new personal/side-projects. I launch simple webs, tools, try new technologies or make utilities for myself.

But how to make this projects available on the public internet?

In order to make that developments accesible anywhere I usually go and use [No-IP](https://www.noip.com/) services, which allows a single user to register three subdomains which can be dynamically updated if we don't have a static IP (DDNS). This has been specially useful for me when looking to expose an app deployed in my local network (home), normally on a Raspberry Pi.

This was until last week, that I discovered the [FreeDNS](https://freedns.afraid.org/) service when accessing a mooo.com subdomain. The project has been there since 2001 up to this day... it's advertisement free and based on open-source software. 

Currently they have a pool of **61,949 domains** some of them working for more than 10 years...

They offer a *premium* account which offers more than 50 subdomains and "extra configuration". But a standard account allows you to create 5 subdomains in [shared domains](https://freedns.afraid.org/domain/registry/) which I find more than useful for publishing my projects.

If you want, you can read the [FAQs](https://freedns.afraid.org/faq/) of the service in order to view all possibilities.

To contribute to this project I shared publicly the [**developer.li**](https://developer.li/) domain (which I was not using...), initially focused for developers, so anybody can create their own subdomain for their side projects, or its own place!


For the main page of my shared domain I made this simple Angular page, which allows you to check for available subdomains. All with the [NES.CSS](https://nostalgic-css.github.io/NES.css/) style which I fell in love.

Check it out at Github!

Do you know any similar alternatives? What do you think about FreeDNS?
